		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>Yelp.com is a popular website and mobile app that allows users to both read and post
			reviews and ratings of
			restaurants and businesses. It has a substantial user-base consisting of over 130 million visitors per month. The
			overwhelming majority of users are casual users of the service and mainly use Yelp as a way to finding restaurants
			based on the reviews of other people. The degree to which casual users contribute to the review economy, so to
			speak, vary greatly, with the majority, only leaving a couple of reviews in total.
		</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>However, there exists a very particular subset of users of the service which Yelp
			have named their “Elite” users.
			According to Yelp, their Elite users are supposed to be a small group of in-the-know users who have a large impact
			on their local community. For example, Yelp claims that these users reveal the hot spots for fellow locals, serve as
			city ambassadors, and have sway in the community.</p>

		<h2>Yelp Reviews</h2>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'> A review is made when a user reviews a business, a business referring to a
			restaurant and other service places. A review contains a rating of 1 to 5 stars, as well as a written statement,
			which is used to clarify the given rating.</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>For our analysis we aim to build a network of reviews, a social network of who is
			friends with who on Yelp, as
			well as use the written review data to ????</p>

		<img style="margin:auto; width:70%;display:block" src="./graphics/Reviews.svg" />

		<h3>Aim of the Analysis</h3>
		The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the properties of Yelp’s Elite users. For this analysis, the focus
		will
		lie on Yelp’s two primary claims about their Elite users:

		<ul>
			<li>Yelp states that its Elite users have high connectivity, which means that they are connected with many other
				users
				and interact often with members of their Yelp community.</li>
			<li>Yelp claims that its Elite users make up the “true heart of the Yelp community.” Third, Yelp claims that its
				users
				have a high contribution, which means that the user has made a large impact on the site with meaningful and
				high-quality reviews.</li>
		</ul>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>The first goal of our project is to analyze whether the above claims about Yelp’s
			Elite users are quantifiably
			valid. For this, we will specify several characteristics which we expect Elite users to have based on these claims.
			We will then perform analyses on Yelp’s dataset in order to determine whether these properties are truly represented
			among the Elite users. The secondary goal of our project is to find which properties are most indicative of Elite
			status on Yelp.
		</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>The analyses for the first goal can be used for this purpose as well. This kind of
			information may be useful for
			those who are interested in becoming Elite members on Yelp. In order to become a member of the “Elite Squad,” a user
			must go through an application process. Despite the suggestions presented above, Yelp doesn’t provide any specific
			criteria on exactly what characteristics a user must have to become Elite. The mystery behind the selection process
			for Elite users is well-documented.</p>

		<h2>Data Story and the Dataset Used</h2>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>
			The dataset is part of the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">YELP
				dataset challenge 2018</a>
			and contains YELP review data from the period 2004 to 2018, where the majority of the reviews are made in North
			America.</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>For this project, the focus was restaurants in Toronto as Toronto is a big city with
			more than a sufficient amount
			of data to perform a serious analysis, but
			small enough for various graph algorithms to be carried out. The reviews and users considered in this project were
			those pertraining to a restaurant in Toronto.</p>

		<h3>Quick Stats for the Toronto Dataset</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Period: March 1st, 2008 to August 1st, 2018</li>
			<li>Reviews: ~380,000</li>
			<li>Users: ~95,000</li>
			<li>Elite users hereof: ~7500</li>
			<li>Restaurants: ~10,000</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prior Work</h2>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>Our analysis involves several standard network analysis algorithms. One is the
			PageRank algorithm first proposed
			by Brin and Page in “The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine” (1998) [3] This algorithm was
			originally intended to measure the importance of web pages in web search, but we utilize it to measure the
			importance of nodes in our network. Another algorithm that we use is the Clauset-Newman-Moore community detection
			algorithm proposed by Clauset et al. in “Finding community structure in very large networks” (2004) [4]. We utilize
			this algorithm for finding communities within our networks so as to see how well certain nodes are connected to
			various communities. Our project also utilizes an algorithm for finding betweenness centrality proposed by Brandes
			in “A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality” (2001) [5]. We use this algorithm to determine how “central” a
			node is in our network structures.
		</p>

		<h2>Social Network Analysis</h2>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>A big part of this analysis involves analyzing the influence of Elite users in Yelp’s
			social network. The resulting social graph
			is
			undirected and rather large, with 95,000 nodes and 380,000 edges. The size of the network means some of our
			algorithms take an unreasonable amount of time to run, however, we did it anyway!</p>

		<h3>Communities within the Social Network</h3>
		<h3>Robustness Analysis</h3>
		<img src="./plots/robustness_plot.svg" />

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>
			To quantify the influence of the elite users in the social network, an experiment was conducted wherein a fraction
			of users corresponding to 1 percent of the elite user base was removed in each iteration, until a number of users
			equal to the number of elite users, was removed. The social network contained just under 7500 elite users, meaning
			that 75 users were removed in each iteration. The largest connected component was calculated for each iteration,
			which tells us how many users are actually part of the social network, and those that were only connected to the
			social network via an elite user which was removed, will no longer be part of the largest connected component.
		</p>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>
			The figure tells us that by removing all elite users from the network, the total number of nodes in the social
			network drops to around 65% of the original size, while only around 0.5% of the total number of nodes were removed.
			For removing regular users only, we see that the network size drops by around 4% after removing 7500 users, and for
			random users, i.e. a mix of both elite and regular users, the resulting loss of network size is around 5%.
		</p>
		<h2>Review Network Analysis and Text Analysis</h2>

		<h3>Rating Distribution</h3>
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>The second component of our work was analyzing the text present in the reviews. As
			previously states, there are
			approximately 380,000 reviews of Toronto restaurants. These reviews are dated and thus we can determine if a user
			was elite when they made a review. Before beginning with any text analysis, it is relevant to check how elite and
			regular users differ in the distribution of the number of stars they award. If one assumes that most restaurants are
			in some middle tier, with some much better and some worse, we would expect to see a distribution resembling a bell
			curve. </p>

		<img style="margin:auto; width:70%;display:block" src="./plots/review_dist.svg" />

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>As we can see, the elite users mostly give four or three star reviews, although the
			distribution is shifted to the
			higher reviews. In contrast, we notice that the regular users have a rating distribution more resembling an inverse
			bell curve. The highest fraction comes from five star reviews and then it decreases down to two stars and finally
			rises slightly with one star reviews having a greater fraction than two star reviews. This may indicate, or conform
			to preconceived notions, that regular users are not as good at distinguishing mid-tier restaurants and are so skew
			their ratings higher or lower.
		</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>Beginning our text analysis, we investigated how word choice compares between elite
			and non-elite users and across
			star ratings using TF-IDF scores. A TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) score for a given word and
			document is large if the word appears frequently in the document but infrequently across all documents. Thus, the
			higher the TF-IDF score, the more important and unique a word is to the specific document. The TF-IDF results are
			visualized in the generated word clouds.</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>[Insert Wordclouds]</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>As we can see, words of praise and negativity strongly associate with 5 star and 1
			star reviews, respectively.</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>We also examined the length of the reviews written, excluding common english
			stopwords such as ‘as’, ‘the’, etc.
			There is clearly a slight downward trend, with lower ratings yielding longer reviews. The elite users also clearly
			write more than the regular users, which makes sense given their status.</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>[Insert graph]</p>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>We can see the trend in review length, but what we are most interested in are the
			trends in review sentiment. So,
			we
			partitioned the reviews based on their average sentiment into three categories: those below one standard deviation
			of
			the average sentiment, above one standard deviation, and in between. First, we see that the low sentiment decreases
			and the high sentiment increases as the number of stars increase, which is expected. We also see that the mid-tier
			sentiment decreases, which would indicated that high star reviews yield more extreme sentiment. On close analysis,
			we
			notice some additional trends. It appears that regular users, compared to elite users, are inclined to use more
			sentiment inline with the stars of the reviews. So, 5 star reviews yield more high sentiment, and less low
			sentiment.
			This might mean that elite users have slightly more balanced reviews while regular users are inclined to hyperbole
			and stronger emotions.</p>
